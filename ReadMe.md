## Description

InsecureBanking is an insecure banking application allowing for account creation, a login, deposit, withdraw and an account summary page. The project was created using a standalone Single Page App (SPA) using React Routing, React components, state managment, Regex for form validation and styling with Bootstrap and CSS.

This project builds upon a Single Page React Application (SPA) architecture for a basic banking application. It's important to note that this project adopts a different approach, using React and React Router without a module bundler or imports, resulting in a single-file SPA.

Implemented email validation using regular expressions.
Combined similar functions to reduce code duplication for better organization and maintainability.
Enhanced the user interface (UI) by applying Bootstrap to the homepage, cards, and custom CSS to the navbar.

Utilized Prettier to ensure consistent code formatting for improved readability.

## Functionality to be added

I would like to reduce much of the code by using formik libraries for form validation.
